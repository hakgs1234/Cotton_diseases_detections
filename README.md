# Cotton Diseases Detection

## Overview

The **Cotton Diseases Detection** project is designed to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in identifying diseases affecting cotton plants. This project leverages deep learning techniques and image processing to accurately classify various cotton diseases, providing valuable insights for effective crop management.

## Features

- **Disease Classification:** Identifies different types of cotton diseases from images.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for uploading images and receiving disease predictions.
- **High Accuracy:** Utilizes advanced deep learning models to ensure high accuracy in disease detection.

## Datasets

The following datasets are used for training and evaluating the model. You can download them from Kaggle:

1. **[Cotton Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/cotton-disease-dataset)**
   - Contains labeled images of cotton leaves affected by various diseases.

2. **[Plant Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishpatel26/plant-disease-detection-using-keras)**
   - A comprehensive dataset for various plant diseases, including cotton.

3. **[PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)**
   - A large dataset of plant images with annotations for multiple diseases, including cotton.
